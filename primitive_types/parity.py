'''
Write expressions that use bitwise operators, equality checks, and Boolean operators to do the following
in O(1) time
1. Right propagate the rightmost set bit in x, e.g., turns (01010000)_2 to (01011111)_2
2. Compute x mod a power of two, e.g., returns 13 for 77 mod 64
3. Test if x is a power of 2, i.e., evaluates to true for x = 1, 2, 4, 8..., false for all other values.
